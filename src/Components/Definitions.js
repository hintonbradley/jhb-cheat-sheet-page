The object references in the keys are held weakly, meaning that they are a target of garbage collection (GC) if there is no other reference to the object anymore.<br><b>Note</b>: One difference to Map objects is that WeakMap keys are not enumerable (i.e., there is no method giving you a list of the keys).",
